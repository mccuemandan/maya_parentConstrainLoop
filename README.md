# maya_parentConstrainLoop
parent constrain loop for maya python

define parent objects
define children objects
input amount of things to parent constrain

goes through and parent constrains child objects to corresponding parent objects

e.g. adding 100 "headLightBeams" to 100 moving "motorcycle" objects
